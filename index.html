    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Greetings!</h2>
          <p>My name is Sarah Block, and I am a student studying software development at Northcentral Technical College.</p>
          <p>As someone who grew up surrounded by technology, I have always been interested in learning about how the devices and programs we use every day are created and maintained. In the future, I hope to be someone who is able to create these programs. 
          If you are interested in learning more about my work experience please check out my resume, and if you would like to see what I have been working on recently check out my projects page.</p>
